> **[Postman API key management is available on Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)**

The [Postman API](/docs/developer/postman-api/intro-api/) enables you to integrate Postman into your development toolchain, but requires API keys to do so. Team Admins can manage the Postman API keys your team creates at scale, ensuring you maintain compliance and security across your organization. Teams can control the creation of API keys, their expiration dates, and revoke keys when needed.

You must be a [Team Admin or Super Admin](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to use the Postman API key management dashboard.

> SCIM API keys can be managed in [Team Settings](http://go.postman.co/settings/team/auth).

## Managing Postman API keys

To open the [Postman API key management dashboard](http://go.postman.co/manage-postman-keys), select **Team > Manage Postman Keys** in the Postman header.

The dashboard lists all of the Postman API keys your team has created. To view enabled, disabled, or revoked keys, select or clear the checkboxes next to **View**.

You can review when a key was generated, its expiration date, who created it and their level of access within the team, and when it was last used. You can also search by key value if you need to locate a specific key, filter by user by selecting **Created by**, and sort by newest, oldest, and recently used.

Tags next to the key name will specify if the key is currently enabled or if it's been disabled or revoked. You can hover over the revoked tag to see if they were revoked by a Team Admin or due to inactivity past the expiry date. Revoked API keys will display their revocation date under their creation date.

### Revoking API keys

You can revoke an individual API key in the [Postman API key management dashboard](http://go.postman.co/manage-postman-keys) by hovering over it and selecting **Revoke**. To revoke multiple API keys at once, select the checkboxes next to each key, then select **Revoke** above the list.

Postman notifies users by email when their API keys are revoked.

### API key settings

You can edit your team settings in the [Postman API key management dashboard](http://go.postman.co/manage-postman-keys) by selecting **API Key Settings**.

Automatically, anyone in your team can generate Postman API keys. To not allow this, select the toggle next to **Allow anyone in your team to generate API keys**. You can also set the expiration settings for all keys generated by your team under **Set expiry for API keys**. This setting will override any expiration choices that users have made previously and will be effective for all of your team's Postman API keys moving forward.

If you need to revoke all of the Postman API keys generated by your team, select **Revoke All**. Postman notifies users by email when their API keys are revoked.
