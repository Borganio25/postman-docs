> **Performance testing is available on [Postman Free, Basic, and Professional plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).** To learn more about availability for Enterprise plans, contact the [Postman sales team](https://www.postman.com/company/contact-sales/).

Performance testing enables you to simulate user traffic, so you can observe how your API behaves under load and find out if the performance meets expectations. It can also help you identify any issues or bottlenecks that affect performance. You can use the _Collection Runner_ to test the performance of your API with the same requests, collections, and environments you use for [functional API tests](/docs/collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/).

To configure a performance test, [create a collection](/docs/collections/using-collections/) with the requests you want to send to your API. Postman uses these requests to simulate the activity of your API's users. In the Collection Runner, you can set the duration of the test and the number of _virtual users_. Each virtual user runs the requests in the specified order in a repeating loop. All of the virtual users operate in parallel to simulate real-world load on your API. You can also choose whether the number of virtual users is fixed for the duration of the test or gradually ramps up during the test.

The performance test runs on your computer and not in the cloud. When you start the test, the Collection Runner displays performance metrics in real time. You can view the average response time, error rate, and throughput for all requests or individual requests. You can also view details about errors that occurred during the test to help identify the source of any performance issues.

## Configuring a performance test

> **Use the Postman desktop app to configure and run performance tests.** You can't use the Postman web app for performance testing. During a performance test, all requests are sent from the host computer where you are running the Postman desktop app.

Before you configure a performance test, [create a collection](/docs/collections/using-collections/) with the requests you want to use to simulate user activity. Each virtual user runs the selected requests in the specified order and repeats the sequence throughout the test. Multiple virtual users all operate in parallel to simulate real-world usage of your API.

To configure a performance test in the Postman desktop app, do the following:

1. Select **Collections** in the sidebar and select the collection you want to use for performance testing.
1. On the collection's **Overview** tab, select <img alt="Runner icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-runner-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> **Run**.

    <img alt="Select Run from the collection overview" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/collection-runner-button.jpg" width="350px"/>

    > You can also select <img alt="Runner icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-runner-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> **Runner** from the Postman footer and drag a collection from **Collections** or **History** in the sidebar.

1. Select the **Performance** tab.
1. (Optional) Change the order the requests are run in by dragging a request to a new location. To skip a request, clear the checkbox next to its name.

    > Performance tests execute all of the requests selected in the Collection Runner in order, and each virtual user runs through the sequence of requests. This helps you test the performance of your API workflows. To test API calls in isolation, you can run performance tests on individual requests instead.

1. Enter the number of **Virtual users**. While the test is running, each virtual user runs the selected requests in the specified order in a repeating loop. A higher number of virtual users puts increased load on your API.

    > The maximum number of virtual users you can simulate depends on available system resources and the collection you're using. Learn more about [virtual users and system resources](#virtual-users-and-system-resources).

1. Enter the **Test duration** in minutes.
1. Select a **Load Profile**.

    * **Fixed** - The number of virtual users you specified is used throughout the test.
    * **Ramp up** - Enter a **Ramp up duration** in minutes. During the ramp-up period, the number of virtual users gradually increases to the number of users you specified.

1. When you're ready to begin the performance test, select **Run**.

> Your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) gives you a limited number of performance runs you can use each month. A message will display in the Collection Runner when you're approaching your usage limit. Learn more about [resource usage](/docs/administration/resource-usage/#performance-test-usage) in Postman.

### Virtual users and system resources

The maximum number of virtual users a performance test can simulate depends on available system resources and the collection used for the test. Using pre-request or test scripts will reduce the number of virtual users that can be simulated.

Use the following guidelines to understand how many virtual users you can simulate:

* A host with 8 CPU cores and 16 GB RAM can simulate up to 250 virtual users
* A host with 16 CPU cores and 32 GB RAM can simulate up to 500 virtual users

Attempting to simulate a higher number of virtual users may cause inaccurate metrics and reduced throughput (requests per second). Postman recommends running a small test with 10 to 20 virtual users and observing system resource usage. You can use this information to estimate that maximum number of virtual users that can be simulated for your collection and host computer.

> If you have a problem with the performance testing feature, contact the [Postman support team](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us). Make sure to attach your [Postman logs](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025298633-How-to-get-logs-from-the-Postman-Desktop-app) in your support request.

## Viewing performance metrics

During a performance test, all requests are sent from your computer where you are running the Postman desktop app. The **Summary** tab displays performance metrics in real time so you can observe how your API performs under load.

<img alt="Viewing performance metrics" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/performance-test-graph-v10-15.jpg"/>

You can view the following information about the performance test:

* Name of the collection being run and the active environment (if any). Select the name to open the collection or environment.
* The number of virtual users (VU). Each virtual user simulates the behavior of a real-world user by running the collection in a repeating loop, in parallel with other virtual users.
* Start time, duration, and load profile (fixed or ramp up).
* **Total requests sent** - The total number of requests sent across all virtual users.
* **Requests/second** - The number of requests sent each second during the performance test, a measure of throughput.
* **Avg. response time** - The response time in milliseconds of all requests averaged together.
* **Error rate** - The percentage of requests that result in an error. Responses other than 2xx responses are considered errors.

From the **Summary** tab, you can take the following actions:

* Select **Stop** to stop the performance test.
* Select **Run Again** to configure and start the performance test again.
* Select **All Runs** to view a list of all past performance runs for the collection.
* Select the name of a request to open the request.

### Customizing the performance view

The **Summary** tab displays a graph with real-time metrics for virtual users, requests per second, average response time, and error rate percentage.

Hover over a point on the graph to view more details.

<img alt="Getting performance details" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/performance-test-hover-v10-15.jpg" width="600px"/>

Select a metric in the legend below the graph to show or hide that metric in the graph.

<img alt="Getting performance details" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/performance-test-show-legend-v10-15.jpg" width="600px"/>

Use the dropdown lists to view data for a specific request. You can also select the response time metrics you want to view. The following metrics are available:

* **Avg. response** - The response time in milliseconds of all requests averaged together.
* **Min response** - The lowest observed response time.
* **Max response** - The highest observed response time.
* **99th percentile** - 99% of all response times are equal to or less than this value.
* **95th percentile** - 95% of all response times are equal to or less than this value.
* **90th percentile** - 90% of all response times are equal to or less than this value.

To change the graph back to the default view, select **Reset**.

## Viewing error details for performance tests

During a performance test, requests that result in a response other than a 2xx status code are tracked as errors. You can view details about the top errors that occurred during the test and error trends over time. Use this information to gain insight into when errors are occurring and the possible causes.

### Viewing top errors

You can view top errors on the **Summary** tab while the performance test is running or after the test is complete.

Hover over a point on the graph to view the top three errors at that point.

<img alt="Getting error details" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/performance-test-hover-v10-15.jpg" width="600px"/>

Select the **Error rate** to view the top errors for the entire test.

<img alt="Viewing top errors" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/performance-test-top-errors-10-15.jpg" width="600px"/>

### Viewing error trends

You can view error trends after the performance test is complete. The error trend shows the top five errors that occurred during the test and the frequency of those errors over time. This information can help you understand how error rates change in response to increased load on your API.

To view error trends, select the **Errors** tab. You can also select the **Error rate** on the **Summary** tab and select **View Error Trends**.

<img alt="Viewing error trends" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/performance-test-errors-graph-v10-15.jpg"/>

You can view the following information about the error trends:

* **Error rate** - The percentage of requests that result in an error. Responses other than 2xx responses are considered errors.
* **Errored requests / Total requests sent** - The number of requests resulting in errors compared to the total number of requests sent across all virtual users.
* **Top error** - The type of error that occurred most often during the test.
* **Top request with errors** - The request that had the highest number of error responses. Select the request name to open the request.

From the **Errors** tab, you can take the following actions:

* Hover over a point on the graph to view more details.
* Select a metric in the legend below the graph to show or hide that metric in the graph.
* To view the error trends for a specific request, select the request in the dropdown list. This information can help you understand which requests are associated with certain types of errors. To change the graph back to the default view, select **Reset**.
